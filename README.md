# DRQN
This experiment is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05521. I wanted to test how generalization works in RL. So we train an agent in certain set of an environments and test the agent in an environments which wasnt in the training set. We want to see that is the agent able to keep performance of the training set in an unseen maps.
